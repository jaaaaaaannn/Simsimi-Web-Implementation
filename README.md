# Simsimi API implementation for web
This is a simple implementation of the simsimi API which allows JSON requests from desired web sources.
Acquire an API key from developers.simsimi.com and change the apiKey variable in script.js.
upload api.php inside the php folder to your host and change the apiUrl variable in script.js to point to your php file.

--I will add other implementations aside from php in the future.
